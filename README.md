# sfcc-cartridges.nvim
Ah, yes. Finally.

## Why?
Because nothing else feels more painful than to write the long require strings.

## How to?
Just install it with your plugin manager and put that lua code somewhere in your config
```
require('sfcc-cartridges')
```

## Dependencies?
Yes, just one - `find`.
